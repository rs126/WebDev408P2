# M3.2 Application Letter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. In this project we aim to mostly use plain HTML and minimal CSS 
to markup a letter to a fellow PHD student on a University Intranet about their 
college application. 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project. 

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project. The Live Server icon can
be found at the top right of the VSCode Window when you click on the html document.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
Note: While there are tests present they will not work for this project.
This project mainly concerns the letter as opposed to testing the 
functionality of the webpage.
